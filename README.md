# Code Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of code and projects I developed during and beyond my PhD at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. It includes learning exercises, side projects, and research scripts not included in published work. This repository serves as a portfolio of my coding experience and ongoing exploration of data science and analytical methods in cancer research. It is actively maintained and updated as new work is completed.

## Contents

- **Research Code**  
  Scripts and analysis pipelines used in my PhD research projects (please refer to the repository [UW-PhD-code](https://github.com/Albert-R-Wang/UW-PhD-code)), including:
  - Data/image analysis, quantification, and visualization
  - Bulk RNA-seq data processing and analysis
  - Workflow automation
  - Figure generation for publications

- **Learning Projects**  
  Code from tutorials and personal learning, covering topics such as:
  - Single-cell RNA-seq analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Small tools and helper functions for data processing and visualization.
  - Exploratory data analysis

## Notes

- This code is provided as-is for educational use and to document my learning process.
- Certain project-specific data and proprietary materials are not included due to privacy and data sharing restrictions.
